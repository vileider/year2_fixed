"modern binary exploitation methods require a deep understanding of Assembly language, Computer Architecture, and the fundamentals of binary exploitation"
Academy, H.T.B. (2023)
"combination of instructions from the binary to execute a particular function and overwrite various pointers to change the program execution flow. This is known as Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks."
Academy, H.T.B. (2023)
"First-out (LIFO) design, which means we can only pop out the last element pushed into the stack. it never gets overflowed to the next item."
Academy, H.T.B. (2023)
"modern operating systems have protections for the stack like preventing code execution or randomly changing the memory addresses."
Lake, J. (2022)
"Integers aren’t just limited by the available registers. They can also be limited by the programming."
Lake, J. (2022)
"If unsigned variables exceed the maximum value, it simply just wraps around using modular arithmetic.
This is basically the same as the odometer in the car ticking over from 999,999, all the way back to zero."
Lake, J. (2022)
"When something like an integer overflow leads to undefined behaviour, there is no pre-specified action that is set to take place."
Lake, J. (2022)
"We could avoid integer overflows by clamping any values that exceed either this minimum or maximum."
Lake, J. (2022)
"In python integer overflows don’t normally occur if the operations are purely performed in Python. Despite this, historical reasons may occasionally raise an OverflowError for integers that lie outside of the required range."
Lake, J. (2022)
"developers should allocate their variables with large enough minimum and maximum values that they can store all possible values that could be computed through a given operation...When the available space is limited, the operations need to be ordered carefully, and the values for the variables also require thorough checking."
Baeldung (2022)
"To avoid race conditions, any operation on a shared resource – that is, on a resource that can be shared between threads – must be executed atomically. "
Baeldung (2022)
"Since race conditions are tied to application semantics, there’s no general way to detect them...usually difficult to reproduce, debug, and eliminate"
Baeldung (2022)
"There’re two kinds of approaches to fight race conditions:
Avoiding shared state, Using synchronizations and atomic operations"
