MIM - Microsoft Identity Manager. Collection of cooperating services. We only use one of those services. The Forefront Identity Manager Synchronisation Service. From now on, everything you read in this tome that mentions MIM will refer to the Synchronisation Service, or the Sync Service to its friends.

The Orchestrator - main controlling engine that determines when MIM profiles are run. Tells it to do all that stuff. It can do it, it just needs to be told to do it.
