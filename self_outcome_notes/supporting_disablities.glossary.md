DDA - The Disability Discrimination Act was a UK law that aimed to end discrimination in employment, education, transportation, and access to goods and services. The act made it illegal to discriminate against someone because of their disability and required organizations to make reasonable adjustments.
Equality Act - The DDA was replaced by the Equality Act 2010. It brought together discrimination laws into a single act. However, the principles of the DDA continue to be relevant today.

Why GDPR was created? - GDPR was created because companies were collecting and using their personal information. The EU's old laws were not enough to protect privacy. The new rules give more control over their personal information and make sure that companies follow the same rules across all EU countries. The rules also make sure that companies are honest and responsible with personal data, and that there will be consequences if they don't follow the rules.
