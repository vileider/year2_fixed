To improve Agile development process **Scrum** or **Kanban** framework is in use.
Both follow the same principles and support Agile practices.

(Red Hat, 2022)
**Scrum** helps to manage work for small teams, "is implemented when a large project
    can be broken up into 2- to 4-week sprints". Retrospectives at the end of sprint let teams to inspect what have been done and add necessary adjustment.

(Racasan, M., 2022)
**Kanban** does not have to stay in a strict timebox like sprints in Scrum.
    "...everything is continuously planned in Kanban, and picked up as work in progress moves to completion...". There are no formal roles in Kanban.
