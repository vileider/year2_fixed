Buffer Overflows - A buffer overflow occurs when a program receives data that is longer than expected, it overwrites the entire buffer memory space on the stack. This can overwrite the next Instruction Pointer, which causes the program to crash because it will attempt to execute instructions at an invalid memory address. By forcing the program to crash, this is the most basic example of exploiting buffer overflows - known as a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.

Integer overflow - When maximum defined sizes for integers are exceeded, the result may cause an error, or it may return an incorrect result within the integer length limit. An integer overflow attack can occur when an integer is used in an arithmetic operation and the result of the calculation is a value in excess of the maximum size of the integer. For example, 8 bits of memory are required to store the number 192. If the process adds 64 to this number, the answer 256 will not fit in the allocated memory, as it requires 9 bits.

Race condition - software error that occurs when the order in which things happen is not considered properly by the programmer running code on an application. Race conditions often occur in parallel processes. However, they can occur within one program. It typically occurs when your application has access to the same shared data and attempts to change variables within it simultaneously. Applications can become vulnerable to race conditions if they interact with other applications that use parallel processing or multiple threads

Clamping - is the process of limiting a position to an area. Unlike wrapping, clamping merely moves the point to the nearest available value.

Atomic operations - in concurrent programming are program operations that run completely independently of any other processes.

Phishing - is when attackers send malicious emails designed to trick people into falling for a scam. Typically, the intent is to get users to reveal financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
Phishing is an example of social engineering: a collection of techniques that scam artists use to manipulate human psychology.
