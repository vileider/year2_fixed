(Wideman 2001)
While reading Wideman's article I have notice he defined 4 bullet points
in project Life Cycle
· Concept
· Planning
· Execution
· Transfer.

In the middle of the project original planning might not work. Changes in the project can effect in significant higher costs.
changes can also reschedule planned project end. 
To keep high satisfaction of participants project manager must maintain good communication with them.
It is manager's duty to keep positive environment for all parties involved in the project.
 
Potential threats to project completion are not always the same.(Wideman 2001)
I should seek for solutions like:
· Learn how to understand the role of the various stakeholders, and how this information may be
used as an opportunity to improve both the perception and reception of the project.
· Identify the real nature of each stakeholder group's business and their consequent interest in the
project.
· Understand stakeholder behaviour and motivation.
· Assess how they may react to various approaches.
· Pinpoint the characteristics of the stakeholders' environment and develop appropriate responses
to facilitate a good relationship.
· Learn project management's role in responding to the stakeholders drive behind the project.
· Determine the key areas which will have the most impact on the successful reception of the
project.
