* loose coupling - means that elements of the system network are connected to each but work independently.
    While one component is at risk others continue to work. A system that uses loose coupling adapts to 
    the changes easier. By outsourcing some modules, efficiency could be improved.
(Greer, 2008)
* separation of concerns - It is a concept of elements in the system, that should have a singularity of purpose. Thanks to that system become more stable. SOC could be achieved by:
    - Horizontal SOC divides an application into layers of functionality based on their role.
    - Vertical SOC divides modules based on their feature. Vertical separation could be integrated with Horizontal SOC.
    - Aspect SOC(Aspect-oriented programming) refers to aspects distributed across multiple components.
    - Dependency direction establishes an entity that possesses the highest potential for reuse. It separates the "busiest" component and makes it independent and reusable.
    - Data concerns are a principle where components should be created without hardcoded data values. Instead, data should be processed at request.
    - Behaviour Concerns mean that method, component, or function is expected to 
    contain data and behavior relevant only to its name.
    - Extending concerns enhances existing concerns by configuration or dynamic discovery process.

* gang of four - four authors of the book about design patterns. The book called "Design patterns: Elements of reusable Object-oriented software" describes 23 programming design patterns. Patterns divided into 3 categories
    - Creational
    - Structural
    - Behavioural

* multi-tiered architectures - organized software components provide functionality. Most common 3-tier architecture creates a layer of:
    - Interface
    - logic
    - data management
