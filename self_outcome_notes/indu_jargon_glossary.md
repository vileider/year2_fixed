* loose coupling - means that elements of system network are connected to each but work independently.
    While one component is at risk others continue to work. System that uses loose coupling adapts to 
    the changes easier. By outsourcing some module, efficiency could be improved.
(Greer, 2008)
* separation of concerns - It is an concept of elements in the system, that should have singularity of purpose. Thanks to that system becomes more stable. SOC could be achieved by:
    - Horizontal SOC divides an application into layers of functionality basing on their role.
    - Vertical SOC divides modules basing on their feature. Vertical separation could be integrate with Horizontal SOC.
    - Aspect SOC(Aspect oriented programming) refers to aspect distributed across multiple components.
    - Dependency direction establish entity that posses highest potential for reuse. It seperates "busiest" compoenent and make it independent and reusable.
    - Data concerns it is a principle where caomponents should be created without hardcoded data values. Instead data should be processed at request.
    - Behavior Concerns means that method ,compoennt or function is expected to 
    contain data and behaviour relevant only to its name. 

* gang of four
* multi-tiered architectures.
