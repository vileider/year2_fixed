What is Quality assurance?
(Bose, 2022)
Referring to Bose`s article, it is more expensive to fix an
error in the early planning stage rather in a late development or production.
After analyzing requirements quality assurance teams have to design the tests.
(StudySmarter, 2023)
With high quality, an organization builds trust, and as a result, become more competitive.
Quality assurance gives confidence. QA's goal is to detect errors before the product will be given to the customer. The simplified plan of the QA process looks like this:
- Planning clear goals and predicting potential problems
- Starting assessments and setting up control points
- Reassuring that everything goes as  expected
- Implementing quality procedures
