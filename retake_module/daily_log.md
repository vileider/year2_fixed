While revisiting my learning outcome reflection on the quality assurance process, I was surprised to notice that I hadn't written much about this specific topic. To address this, I plan to delve into the projects I worked on during my summer placement and review past projects that were not included in my previous submission.

I was trying to understand how to properly write Harvard references. I spent time comparing which reflections successfully met the referencing requirements and which ones did not. Based on this analysis, I believe I have identified the areas where I made mistakes.

I've been contemplating how to enhance the security of the portfolio website I've been working on for the past 2 weeks. After conducting research, I explored the Let's Encrypt website and its Certbot tool, which I would need to install on my VPS. However, I realize the importance of delving deeper into the topic, planning each step meticulously before proceeding to add an SSL certificate to my website.

Throughout the morning, I dedicated my time to gathering screenshots and MD files for evidence. However, when I attempted to push everything to the repository, I encountered an issue. The SSH key on Bitbucket turned out to be outdated due to my recent OS installation. Consequently, I had to generate a new private key. I resolved the situation by deleting the existing SSH key on Bitbucket and adding the new one. Following this, I was able to successfully push the files to the Bitbucket repository.

In my opinion, I've completed the first stage of the 'Data as a Service' reflection. I plan to revisit this later with the evidence of creating a CI/CD pipeline. Right now, I will focus on writing a reflection about the human aspects in data protection acts.

While I was in the middle of reflecting on the human aspects in security, I received information from the student channel that the portal is not able to read Bitbucket repositories. It appears that I'll need to transfer all my work to GitHub, as apparently it's the platform that is functioning properly.
