(Todorow, delivering high quality 2023)
I should start from the beginning and explain to myself what is the quality assurance process, I realized that quality assurance (QA) isn't just an extra step; it's a key player. QA processes are the backbone, making sure the software we're crafting meets the mark, works reliably, and does what it's supposed to. The cool thing is, these QA processes are spread out across the whole software development journey, touching each phase.
(Hewitt Project Brief)
Starting at the very beginning, I remembered QA's job – ensuring our project's requirements are crystal clear, doable, and no-nonsense. Back in the day, our Coord team stuck to these rules right from the get-go.

Moving on to the Design Phase, QA shows up again. This time, it ensures that the software's design plans aren't just copies of requirements, but also match the best practices of the industry.

But the real magic happens during code reviews and pair programming. QA steps in to catch coding mistakes, spots security weak spots, and makes sure everyone's following the coding rulebook. I still remember the meticulous attention we gave to every line of code, making sure it was top-notch.

Unit testing, a big deal in QA, requires some focus. Our team tackled different types of tests, like lint tests and the next build tests in Teams' CI/CD setup. In the process of evaluating quality assurance processes that can be automated during software development to achieve and maintain project requirements, it's evident that the realm of automation holds significant potential, particularly in the context of our CI/CD pipeline.[LO2.6.2.1]
To be real, hitting MVP deadlines sometimes meant skipping tests like Functional, Integration, Performance, and Security. Tough choices were made.
(Todorow sharing tutorials)
Talking about staying sharp, here comes continuous training. Platforms like LinkedIn Learning and YouTube tutorials came to the team's rescue. We exchanged useful links within the team, all about getting better at what we do.

Communication also gets a shoutout. Tools like Jira boards make sure everyone's on the same wavelength, from team members to stakeholders, all in the name of project quality.

Summing it all up, I see that evaluating quality assurance in software development isn't just a bonus – it's essential. These processes aren't just guards against problems; they're problem-solvers. They fix things up early, making things smoother and users happier. Armed with this understanding, I'm prepared to delve deeper into learning about testing, recognizing that building a pool of pre-written tests and gaining experience will eventually enable me to write tests more efficiently.[LO2.6.2.1] Additionally, I have plans to explore Jenkins CI/CD. While I've taken my initial steps in this area, I'm aware that I'm just at the beginning of this learning journey. All of these efforts will significantly contribute to improving quality assurance in future projects.
