Evaluate the quality assurance processes that can be automated during software development to achieve and maintain project requirements.
What are QA processes?  Where do you find them?  How are they automated? In order to evaluate them you need to be able to set them up - you can do this in Bitbucket or IBM Cloud.  You need to use them to maintain your software quality.  We would expect to see some evidence of research, evidence of linkedin learning courses taken and attempts at implementations - even if they don't work - say so and say what might be going wrong!  Failure is always on the path to success so its important we see that so we can credit you for trying!

(Todorow, delivering high quality 2023)
I think I should start from the beggining and explain to my self what is the quality assurance process
and later i can mmove forward with it. I already prepearde a glossary that explains what is it and how to achieve it i n a few steps. 
In software development, quality assurance (QA) processes are integral to ensuring that the software being developed meets the required standards, is reliable, and functions as intended. QA processes are typically implemented throughout the software development life cycle.
(Hewitt Project Brief)
Starting from the beggining-QA starts by ensuring that the project requirements are clear, feasible, and well-defined. The whole Coord team was sticking to the established rules at the beginning of the project.

At Design Phase QA processes ensure that the software design documents accurately represent the requirements and adhere to industry best practices. Code reviews and pair programming involve QA to identify coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards.
