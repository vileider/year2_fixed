Engaging in a discussion with Neil prompted me to delve deeper into real-world examples that illustrate the practical application of quality assurance processes. This exploration aims to provide a broader perspective on how these automated quality assurance processes can be effectively integrated into software development to achieve and maintain project requirements.

One standout instance of automating quality assurance is the use of ( A &amp; Shrikanth, Jenkins for test automation : Tutorial 2022)Jenkins, a continuous integration orchestrator tool that plays a vital role in maintaining project requirements.[LO2.6.2.1] Jenkins streamlines quality assurance processes through its array of plugins, effectively integrating various test automation tools and frameworks into its pipeline.

Plugin Selenium, a powerful tool for browser automation that facilitates thorough testing of application functionality across different browsers.
One remarkable aspect of Selenium is its support for script writing in over seven programming languages, ensuring accessibility and flexibility.
This adaptability directly contributes to achieving and maintaining project requirements.

The Cucumber testing framework is designed for automated acceptance tests written in the intriguingly named "Gherkin" language. Tailored for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Cucumber boasts a user-friendly syntax presented in simple text. [LO2.6.2.1][LO2.6.2.1]While enhancing project requirements through comprehensive testing, BDD may require some familiarity with Test-Driven Development (TDD) and technical skills to effectively utilize it.

Jenkins culminates the results of these automated tests into an HTML page, which can be further integrated into communication platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack for real-time status updates on job executions. This exemplifies how automated quality assurance can significantly enhance transparency and collaboration, ultimately contributing to maintaining project requirements.
Considering why I need automated quality assurance, it's about ensuring the robustness of my projects and maintaining their alignment with project requirements. As I work on my portfolio project, which I intend to deploy in its alpha version soon, I recognize the importance of a smooth and reliable software development process. Once this project reaches the alpha stage, I plan to implement Jenkins to streamline the quality assurance processes. By doing so, I aim to not only achieve project requirements but also establish a foundation for the project's future success.
[LO2.6.2.1]
In conclusion, my exploration into automated quality assurance processes underscores their pivotal role in ensuring software development aligns with and upholds project requirements. Examples like Jenkins with its Selenium and Cucumber integrations illuminate the transformative power of automation in maintaining project requirements. However, it's essential to critically assess the limitations and complexities inherent in such tools, striving for a balanced implementation that optimizes efficiency while addressing potential challenges. My plan to incorporate automated quality assurance into my portfolio project emphasizes its practical significance in achieving and maintaining project requirements.
