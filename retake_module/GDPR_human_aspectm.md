### Data as a service

In this reflection, I'll look into the human side of information security. Just like I explored the technical aspects earlier, it's important to realize that both human and technical elements are crucial. If either falls short, our desired outcomes could be at risk.

In the previous reflection, I wrote about the General Data Protection Regulation concept, a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented. Its primary focus is on safeguarding personal data and privacy rights, GDPR context of information security lies in its emphasis on safeguarding personal data and privacy rights. GDPR requires organizations to implement effective information security measures to prevent data breaches, protect sensitive information, and uphold individuals' rights and freedoms.

To understand how GDPR affects individuals, I don't need to search far. I can share how it affects me personally. Thanks to GDPR, I have the right to request a copy of my data from any organization that holds it. If I want to withdraw consent from media platforms or online retailers, I can ask to erase my data.

The impact of human aspects on information security, particularly in safeguarding client data, becomes evident through a real-life example. In 2018, British Airways (BA) faced a cyberattack that resulted in a significant data breach. This breach exposed 400,000 individuals to risks like identity theft, fraud, and phishing attacks. The aftermath included damaged trust and reputation for the company. Additionally, BA was fined £20 million due to its failure to adequately protect customer data. The investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office unveiled BA's weaknesses in implementing essential security measures such as encryption, monitoring, and testing.

A possible pitfall of GDPR can arise when a company or an individual is unaware of its applicability. The fact is, GDPR applies to any company. Sometimes, even if individuals are conscious of data regulations, their company might lack adequate staffing and human resources to handle this matter. Even if a company dedicates resources to data protection, it might not ensure proper security. This could involve measures like pseudonymization and pseudo-encryption being inadequately implemented. Another common challenge could be the delayed reporting of data breaches. Some companies lack a clear procedure for reporting breaches, which could lead to delays. In my opinion, it's remarkable that certain million-pound companies aren't giving due attention to cybersecurity. Regardless of a company's worth, prioritizing cyber defense is crucial. It doesn't mean a company worth £10,000 needs to invest extensively, but the investment should align with breach risks. Maintaining minimal security standards should always be a requirement.

To sum up, my exploration into human aspects of information security shows how they combine with technical elements. Just like a coin's two sides, both contribute to safety. This harmony shows that data protection needs both human care and technical tools. It's not just technology, but our commitment too, that secures our digital world. Just as I value my data, I should value the measures protecting it. Both human alertness and technical skill could define my success in information security.
