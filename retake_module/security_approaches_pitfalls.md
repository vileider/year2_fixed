(Saxena, Importance of cyber security: Benefits and disadvantages 2023)
Today, the undeniable importance of cybersecurity has led organizations to adopt a wide variety of security approaches and strategies. Building upon my previous reflection, where I explored examples of cyberattacks and their resulting security breaches, I will now delve into the analysis of common pitfalls within these security approaches. Furthermore, I will emphasize effective remedies to address these pitfalls.

My learnings from IBM underscored the significance of not just knowing security rules but also implementing them within the organization.

Conducting ongoing risk assessments, including checks on database configurations and annual updates to access policies, emerged as pivotal practices.(Todorow, GDPR -human aspect 2023) Reflecting on insights from the "GDPR Human Aspect" reflection, I initially believed that adhering to minimum security standards was sufficient. However, my understanding evolved through an IBM article, revealing that true data security resembles a marathon rather than a sprint. This realization signifies the long-term commitment required to safeguard sensitive information effectively.

IBM also shared invaluable bullet points that enhance the efficiency of risk assessment, thereby minimizing potential pitfalls.[LO2.6.2.4] One such approach involves the discovery and classification of sensitive data, with risk assessment conducted using analytics. Additionally, monitoring all data access patterns aids in revealing suspicious activities. A robust practice to mitigate common pitfalls involves safeguarding sensitive data through encryption. Implementing these practices is instrumental in creating a more secure environment.

Eager to apply these lessons, I engaged in the 'JavaScript Deobfuscation' module on the Hack The Box website to learn common security approaches.[LO2.6.2.4] This endeavor shed light on the significance of deobfuscating code, particularly in interpreted languages like Python, PHP, and JavaScript. Clear execution of code in these languages necessitates obfuscation to prevent exploitation. Encrypted code through obfuscation stops unauthorized use from happening and reverse engineering, helps to make security stronger.

In alignment with my earlier reflection on vulnerabilities, I emphasized the importance of application security in countering software vulnerabilities. Allocating proper value ranges to variables prevents overflows, while modern software with multi-threaded processing demands security updates to prevent race condition attacks.

(Todorow, deobfuscation task 2023)
I'm proud that I managed to complete both the basic and advanced Obfuscation tasks. However, my path took an unexpected turn when I faced the challenge of sending a request to a PHP file on the server using a POST request in cURL. Despite my best efforts, this particular obstacle proved to be a stumbling block, leading to my defeat. This experience highlighted the significance of continuous learning and the need to expand my skill set further. My inability to send a request and decrypt messages underscored the need for a comprehensive understanding of the subject to ensure effective defense against potential breaches.
My journey showed that even small obstacles can both deter and mitigate hacking attempts.[LO2.6.2.4] My efforts to understand and use security methods have shown how important it is to master the subject and keep learning. As I work in the field of cybersecurity, I need to remember that being resilient and adaptable is key to creating strong security.
