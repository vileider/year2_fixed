Simone said that they use tool called Jidoka as a pipeline with tests.
automation that automatically fixes issues is named “Jidoka”.

Simone: code coverage - after completing test you know that the code is legit 100%.

TDD:
Barnaby: it is important but it is not possible to implement it everywhere.
Simone: dependency infection is not always testable

If they do not know what are the delivering the not gonna deliver good project

the product should be delivered on time even if is bad quality.

It is important to reassure with customer that we are following into right direction

How important is it to identify results from development and client point of view after delivering the product?

All depends from the client and product.
Achieving any success is worth to talk to customer.
It is beneficial for a customer so he can share his thoughts.
It is worth to check it with analytics tools to see if it giving profit, if it worth the money we spent on that.
