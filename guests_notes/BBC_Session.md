The talked what the do and upcoming BBC anniversary.

Q: upadate emails messages should not be an epic and smaller task attached to it?

Their answer:
A:They create very big epics and lots of "smaller" task attached to it.

Q: if one of you takes the tasks/ticket who can change designated person?
How long do you wait until someone else will take the task?
In case of sickness of other reasons.

A:They react pretty quick, and move the task to not leave tasks behind.

Q: does pure scrum exist or every team/company pick most useful parts?

A:my opinion is that small start-ups or very standalone teams can probably do pure scrum but the bigger the organisation and/or more interconnected the team the harder it is to be pure due to organisational structures and competing needs. Not necessarily a bad thing just something to be managed on a case by case basis
