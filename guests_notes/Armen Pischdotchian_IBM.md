machines predict , human judges 


Right algorithms can help humans to find an answer for questions
related to big amount of data

Human  advantages over machines
- We know something that machines don't
- We are better at deciding what to do when their isn't much data
- We can gather data from our senses


Narrow Intelligence (weak AI):
AI specialized in one area

Artificial General Intelligence (strong AI):
Computer that can be as smart as human

Artificial Superintelligence
concept of self aware AI


I know that you wanted to prove some point, but still I will ask that question.
question: "When does human decide without enough data?"
