Asking right questions helps solving the problems

While making decisions, it is good to remove options that I do not want first

even when picking something optimal at first look it is worth to check if item from the list could be deliver on time with quality

sometimes there may be no good answer - than only least worst case should matter

If at your job something does not fit :
change team
change task
change manager
change job

It is important to take a lesson from mistakes and move forward.

Reasonable goals are the best 

While working it is important to treat everyone with respect and kindness. Listening others is the key.

Instead saying" you are wrong" I should say "could you explain that again", "I do not understand", "have you thought about this... as an alternative"

it is better to work side by side than face to face, active listening, common goals, give and take.

If I have complex presentation it would good practise if I would show it to other people.

I should keep people informed about progress so that are no sudden surprises
