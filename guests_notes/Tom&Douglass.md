Chat GPT
Douglas does not use it in professional matter
Tom agrees with me that Chat gpt should be use from simple boilerplate pieces of code.

memory management- 
if I use memory profiles 

Tom said i should make pointer to already exsiting object in memory. Istead of creating identiacl one.

adding a timer to a function allows to check performance

douglas recommend preofiles like "Superluminal"
it shows which functions takes most time.

Without proper performance tools I cqan spend hours trying to find a problem
Tom said that good programers know how to use tools



If its about arrays/list it importat that the code goes straight in memory
douglas says that it is about compiler that compile my code most efficiet way.

profiling tools are gonna give me answer what programming language should I use
