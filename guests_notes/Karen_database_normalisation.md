User do not care and should not know how the data is stored

In case something goes wrong with database, I need to be able to recover it

Database management system includes:
-hardware
-software

Database management system stays in the middle between users and database. It is responsible for logical structure of database.

Entity is a real life thing that can be described

Primary key/keys to uniquely identify user
It is quicker to search integers than a string

Simple key - unique parameter

For one to one relation must be good reason.
