As a father of four, I have developed a high level of expertise in active listening. I have been using this skill for so long that I don't even recall where I learned it from. Active listening involves asking repetitive questions to another person and using empathy to help them express their thoughts. For example, asking questions like "Are you sad because of..." or "Are you angry because..." encourages  to communicate more effectively.

While working with students on various projects, I have found that my active listening skills come in handy, especially when dealing with shy or confused students. In such situations, I try to estimate what questions would be appropriate, and if necessary, modify my approach. For instance, if a student seems confused about a project plan, I would ask, "You are confused about this plan because..." instead of simply asking, "Are you okay with the plan?" This approach often helps students to be more forthcoming with their opinions and ideas.

In one of my past projects, a design thinking session with Team Ben Hope, active listening was crucial to encouraging participation from all team members. I found that asking questions like "Hey, what are your thoughts about this?" or "Do you think we should move in this direction because..." helped team members to become more confident and comfortable. This led to an environment where everyone shared their ideas freely, and I didn't need to use active listening as much.

However, I have come to realize that there is always room for improvement, especially when dealing with individuals who may have private difficulties or disabilities that affect their participation. Therefore, while using active listening, I must ensure that I am asking the right questions to help everyone participate fully. Participating in COORD and ITDI teams has helped me to develop my empathy skills further by listening and observing others.

Overall, I have found that active listening is an important skill that has helped me in various areas of my life, including as a father and project lead.
