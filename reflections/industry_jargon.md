LO2.4.2.5
Software services
Explain and apply concepts such as loose coupling, separation of concerns, gang of four, multi-tiered architectures.
Do the research - there are LinkedIn Learning videos that cover these in lots of detail.  Find books online with chapters you can read on these.  Write notes.  Write some code the exemplifies these - Java is a good language for that as its OOP by nature, but you can use any C style language.  You should also then reflect how knowing about these things makes your code better/worse and your system design better/worse!  You could also review an open source software package for these patterns and say how they make the code easier/worse to read/understand.



# what concepts are familiar with 
-reading about loose coupling in practice
(PC mag encyclopedia 2023)
I was reading about loose coupling adn I think I work on loose coupled systems every day.
an example cou;d be any app on my desktop. While navigating on interface i can use functionality, hovewer once I 
would like to use some exdented feature it can downloaded it from external server. An App works fine withoud any additional content
and server sends data to different client without connexting to "my" app.
-write about how I thought it is used
(Todorow, Indu_jargon_glossary)
In terms of using separation of concerns I have been applying dependecy direction concept during my learning process. I have been creating reusable components in multiple projects.(Todorow, BOSOREACT3 ./src folder)
In project called "bosoreact" I created reusable components and styles.
It saved time because I could just reuse already written solution. Also improved readablity by cutting off multiple lines of code and placing mingigfull component, funciton or style name instead.
(Todorow, customfetch.tsx)
I have been using reusable fetch function. In the component i created  I could write spcified data and endponits in function paramater. Function that I created did not posses any data, it processed input on request. I think it was matching data concerns.
(Team Spock, 2023)
Prettier code formater allows me to define a configuration file that specifies the rules and options for formating my code. This configuration file can be shared across multiple IDE. 
During my research relating to "gang of four" I learned that it is a book about
23 design patterns. This book 
    
    gang of four as book i would like to read
    multi tiered architrecture (rest)


# how and where I have been using them
# How can use concepts that I just learned

context/Background?

What interesting I did Today?

What have I learned?

What can be improved?

If any, what do I want to start doing or continue?

If any, what do I want to stop doing?
