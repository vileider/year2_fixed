I would like to write my experience related to software services learning outcomes and emphasize the importance of continuous learning and improvement. By highlighting the use of various concepts and techniques such as loose-coupled systems, separation of concerns, and reusable components, as well as their use of design patterns like the Gang of Four patterns. I will also mention my work with multi-tiered architecture and RESTful API. Overall, I will try to illustrate the value of staying up-to-date with industry trends and continuously developing skills to improve software development practices.
(PC mag encyclopedia 2023)[LO2.4.2.5]
I was reading about loose coupling and I think I work on loose coupled systems every day.
an example could be any app on my desktop. While navigating on the interface I can use functionality, however, once I 
want to use some extended feature I can download it from an external server. An App works fine without any additional content
and the server sends data to a different client without connecting to "my" app.
-write about how I thought it is used
(Todorow, Indu_jargon_glossary)[LO2.4.2.5]
In terms of using separation of concerns, I have been applying the dependency direction concept during my learning process. I have been creating reusable components in multiple projects.(Todorow, BOSOREACT3 ./src folder)
In a project called "bosoreact," I created reusable components and styles.
It saved time because I could just reuse already-written solutions. Also improved readability by cutting off multiple lines of code and placing meaning full component, function, or style name instead.
(Todorow, customfetch.tsx)
I have been using a reusable fetch function. In the component I created, I could write specified data and endpoints in the function parameter. The function, I created did not possess any data, it processed input on request. I think it was matching data concerns.
(Team Spock, 2023)
The prettier code formatter allows me to define a configuration file that specifies the rules and options for formatting my code. This configuration file can be shared across multiple IDE. [LO2.4.2.5]
During my research relating to "gang of four" I learned that it is a book about
23 design patterns. The authors divided the content into 3 categories: Creational, structural, and behavioral.
I have been using some of the patterns because it was the most efficient and logical solution for me.
The patterns that I am familiar with are prototype, bridge, interpreter, State, Template method, and Chain of responsibility.
To be sure that I am using those patterns in the most efficient way I will read the book. I will learn the patterns that might improve
my code quality and move the whole project standard to a higher level.
(live chat project 2022)[LO2.4.2.5]
Multi-tiered architecture divides an application into different logical tiers. I have been using R.E.S.T(Representational State Transfer) architectural style.
REST was implemented into N-Tier Application. Its task was to provide stable communication between the client and server. In that case, REST was responsible for logic.
The interface was written and worked with multiple frameworks and programming languages.
Data management was based on the MYSQL database. During this project, I polished my skills in
organizing n-tier applications.
In a conclusion, I would say that I should and I will read more articles and books about design patterns. Even if I use some of them I might not implement them 100% correctly. I understand that properly used patterns can save time and show professionalism.
