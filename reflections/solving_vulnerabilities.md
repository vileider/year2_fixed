To move to a higher level of cyber technology awareness I was reading multiple articles about that topic.
I read also about recent and past cyber attacks. To delve deeper into this topic and understand it better-used
tool at hackthebox website, which explained how does hacking method called: buffer overflow works. (Todorow, B. 2023 buffer overflow example)
(Tunggal, A.T. 2022)

In April 2019 Facebook has been attacked revealing 146 gigabytes of private data.[LO2.6.2.4]
Analysing the pitfall of that event I can say that a large amount of private data that was exfiltrated from Facebook's servers indicates a lack of proper controls and protections in place to secure user data. (Holmes, A. 2021) The vulnerability that was exploited could be used for several months, caused by a lack of regular security assessments and insufficient vulnerability scans.
I think there was a serious risk that sensitive information could be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or fraud.[LO2.4.2.2]
Revealing user email addresses could cause phishing attacks to trick the user into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. Other risks or threats could occur when the user downloads a malicious file or visits a compromised website- from a link in the user's e-mail or straight on Facebook messenger. [LO2.4.2.2] When a hacker knows the user account, it could start social engineering attack. An example of an engineering attack is the use of manipulation or deception to trick the user into revealing sensitive information or taking actions that compromise the security of their device.
I should look at that from the provider's perspective. [LO2.5.1.2] I think the risk to a service provider is the potential harm to its business, such as financial losses, loss of customer trust, and damage to its reputation. Vulnerabilities in the systems and infrastructure can be exploited, so the provider needs to identify these weaknesses. (Todorow, B. 2023 vulnerabilities glossary) Threats to service providers DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks
occur when an attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data stored by the provider and exploits exploiting buffer overflows.[LO2.4.1.4]
DDoS attacks are designed to overload the provider's systems and cause a disruption of service.(Cobb, M. 2021)
I learned that application security exploits target vulnerabilities in the software used by the provider to provide its services, such as web applications or APIs.
Service providers must implement robust security measures and regularly assess their systems to mitigate these types of threats and minimize their risks.[LO2.6.2.4] [LO2.5.2.4] Reading the blog at the comparitech site I learned that to create future-proof software security solutions, developers should allocate their variables with sufficient minimum and maximum values to store all possible values that could be calculated by a given operation. (Todorow, B. 2023 insights about vulnerabilities). Overflows can be avoided by clamping any values that exceed this minimum or maximum.[LO2.4.1.4]
I know that modern programs and applications are dependent on multi-threaded processing to perform several actions simultaneously.
To prevent race conditions attack regular security updates must be done regularly.
[LO2.5.2.4]
I think scalable and future-proof software security solutions are only possible if there is constant investment in security, including the deployment of advanced security tools, systems to detect and prevent attacks, and technology of security.
