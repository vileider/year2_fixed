(Todorow, B. 2022 Waterfall method)
I have been gathering more information about agile and waterfall to compare both project environments. I compared my knowledge to my notes from my first year at college. By participating in several team projects, I built up my experience. Right now, I think I can identify the moment when group work is drifting towards a non-agile environment.  
  
To explore the topic, I looked for an article about the waterfall on google scholar. (Todorow, B. 2022 Waterfall method)  
I learned that the waterfall method is very strict, and its time box is pre-set.[LO2.4.1.1] 
(Todorow, B. 2022 BBC about Agile)
During an insight session with IT professionals from BBC, I asked what their work methodology looks like. One of the speakers said that pure scrum works in small teams. Although their company environment forces them to adjust organizational structures and competing needs to the most efficient solutions. I think they are balancing between scrum and Kanban frameworks in their workflow.  

Last year I tried to place myself into a scrum master role. Even though the project was not big, it was hard for me to keep high industry standards. 
With small knowledge of scrum, I could not focus on learning agile and participating in a project. 
I think to become a good leader, the person should have experience in different agile methods. 
The article I have read let me understand the project life cycle. (Todorow B. 2022 Agile notes) 
I need to gain more experience before I start leading. I can focus on learning instead of struggling. 

(Todorow B. 2022 Project management) As I wrote in my notes about project management- I should be contacting stakeholders more often. Feedback from them is important and can put me and the whole team on the right track if necessary. When it looks like "original planning might not work" it is important to react quickly. Changes in the project can generate higher costs - that is another reason why communication with stakeholders is important.[LO2.4.1.1]

During the last 2 years, I have participated in many projects. Team members have been working during the sprint - which is like the waterfall method because of its fixed dates of the sprint cycle. (Todorow B. 2022 Project management) 

At the beginning of every project, we set up a time for daily stand-ups. Due to personal commitments, it was rare to gather everyone every day at virtual meetings. In case of absence, members have been writing their development process on the project channel. Stand-ups have been recorded so everyone has been up to date with current progress.[LO2.4.1.1]

Sometimes it happens that one passionate team member starts working on many tasks at once, another does not communicate and someone can behave offensively. When the environment becomes non-agile, I was trying to take a step back from the project and think about the situation. I was arranging a team meeting and we were trying to get back to the agile cycle by talking about possible solutions.[LO2.4.1.1]

After the first two months of the second year, I started participating differently. I was observing others and observing scrum masters. I started analyzing my behavior during the sprint and what my motivation was. I understood that every member is an individual and needs to be treated with respect.(Todorow B. 2022 Agile notes) It is worth chatting in the group, just to improve relations with other members. Continuous team integration makes everyone feel better and that leads to open discussions when everyone is free-minded.[LO2.4.1.1]
(Todorow, B. 2022 Waterfall method)
In my opinion, a difference between waterfall and agile is the way that project requirements are determined.[LO2.4.1.1] In a waterfall project, the requirements are carefully defined at the beginning of the project and then remain fixed throughout the project. In an agile project, the requirements are understood at a high level at the beginning, but they are allowed to evolve and adapt as the project progresses.
In a non-agile environment, the principles of agile can still be applied to help improve the project management process. I think this might involve implementing agile practices such as regular meetings with the customer to get feedback and make adjustments, using iterative development to continually improve the product, and focusing on delivering value to the customer.

In the next couple of months, I will improve my awareness of potential non-agile situations. I think I know how to give small guidance to the team to let us stick to Agile principles. It might often happen that there will be problems I cannot solve, but at least I know where I should seek help. I know I must be respectful to other team members, their absence can be caused by personal issues.  
 
When I will participate in the next couple of projects I will improve teamwork by asking others what their expectations are. I will also speak with my mentor, to ask about his company's approach to agile methodology.  
Once I will acquire knowledge with experience, I will be imitating industry solutions in my workgroup.
