The subject of technology solutions in typical business environments is vast, and in this reflection, I will attempt to cover only a small portion based on my experience and research.

Technology solutions in typical business environments can involve both hardware and software, with solutions being specifically designed for particular tasks. In modern business environments, servers or serverless services are often necessary to manage data, whether it is an application, website, data storage, or game server. Ultimately, the solution depends on the task requirements.

One example of a technology solution that I encountered was during an interview at a tailoring company. The owner required a system to organize and quickly display reports for multiple warehouses and thousands of items. The solution that he chose was a cloud service with an application that managed data via a user-friendly interface, with any reports or alerts managed through a given API. This solution helped the owner to monitor and control the inventory and sales of the company more efficiently and effectively.

Another example of a technology solution that I used was for a student project. I had to create a data-driven nutrition tracker app for mobile devices. The solution that I chose was a simple database that stored the userâ€™s food intake and nutritional information. The database was connected to the app through a REST API, which is a way of communicating data between different systems. This solution allowed the app to access and update the data easily and securely.

A third example of a technology solution that I implemented was for my work at Douglas Bar. I wrote serverless functions using AWS Lambda, which is a service that lets you run code without managing servers. Serverless functions simplified my work for one person and provided a decent security level while being cost and time-efficient. They also enabled me to scale up or down the functions depending on the demand.

The last example of a technology solution that I learned about was the UHI Azure environment. This is a designated system that handles many independent systems with a high level of security enforced by the law. Every organization or company is obligated to secure personal data, and the UHI Azure environment provides a platform for doing so.

In conclusion, technology solutions in typical business environments are diverse and dynamic, and they require careful consideration of the task, time, and cost factors. I found the best solution for tasks by attempting to copy industry solutions and implementing them into team work. However, modern solutions are continuously evolving, with big companies like AWS, Google, and IBM providing hundreds of tools, services, and workspaces, including solutions for problems that have not yet occurred. Therefore, I need to keep learning and updating my knowledge and skills in order to find the most suitable technology solutions for different situations.
