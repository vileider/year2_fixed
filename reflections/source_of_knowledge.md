Last year I asked Tom McCallum and Douglas Barr about their preferred IT-related media, and they recommended following interesting channels on Twitter.[LO2.6.2.3] I took their advice and installed the app, searching for topics related to IT. I discovered that GitHub and Code.org were among the most popular channels, and to keep up with new features of programming languages and specific frameworks, I also followed JavaScript-related topics. Additionally, I subscribed to YouTube channels such as Traversy Media, Web Dev Simplified, The Coding Train, Fireship, and others, which provided the latest framework features, tutorials, and updates.

Moreover, I read websites such as www.computerworld.com, which covers a range of technology topics, with a particular focus on core areas of IT, including operation systems, software, and blockchain. This website also offers relevant information about leading technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google. It provides news, analysis, reviews, opinions, podcasts, and videos on IT trends, careers, business technology, and more. Another website I follow is www.siliconrepublic.com, which covers a range of topics, such as business, innovation, careers, enterprise, start-ups, science, and social media. This website provides analysis, opinions, podcasts, and videos on the latest trends and developments in the tech industry, which often serve as a source of inspiration for me.

My plan for the future is to continue to follow the channels on Twitter that I found helpful in the past year. It is an excellent way to stay informed. I will also explore new channels and sources of information. I am going to keep up with industry websites like Computerworld and Silicon Republic.
Another way to stay informed is by attending IT-related conferences and events. 
I have my ticket for dev.js Summit 2023 event(19.04.2023)
These events often feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, and networking opportunities, which can help me stay current with the latest IT developments and also connect with industry experts and professionals. Finally, I will consider taking online courses on LinkedIn Learning and get certifications.
