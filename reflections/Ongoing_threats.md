In this reflection, I would like to show how important it is to manage risk when working with computer systems. I think I should discuss known risk management strategies and solutions that I have learned about during the time spent in the ITDI and COORD teams.

I believe that appraising and managing risk are strongly related to gaining experience. When I write a piece of code, I am aware of potential threats and actively propose adjustments to the design and implement security patches. Another option is to discuss potential threats with experts whom I can find during the guest speaker sessions at UHI. Right now, I do not have a problem getting in touch with one of them. While I am in the ITDI team, I could ask one of the people who lead placements what other ways there are of managing information systems.

I cannot access Microsoft Identity Manager as a student because I need to create a function for anonymizing passwords first. During the ITDI stand-up, Alistair said that for testing any changes in the code, I should fill up the password value with dummy data instead of passwords. That would secure vulnerabilities from unauthorized personnel like me and other students. Furthermore, we continued the conversation about threats, and he said that branches are secure from unauthorized code push or merge. In the COORD group, the main branch is secured, and any changes are merged to it only when one or two senior developers review and approve changes. Alistair said that sometimes developers might make a mistake, and the code is moved to production. To solve issues, he suggests pair programming with a person who committed the trouble-causing code.

While speaking with my mentor, he said that at Adobe, they run automatic code scans to catch any ongoing threats. I am happy that I can hear about real industry solutions for managing risk and threats.

In conclusion, managing risk is crucial when working with computer systems. I plan to continue seeking advice from experts, learning about new risk management strategies, and applying these practices in my work. By prioritizing risk management, I should try to create secure and reliable software that meets industry standards.
