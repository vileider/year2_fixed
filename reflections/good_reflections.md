I was exploring how to develop my skills and attributes related to creativity, self-motivation and self-awareness. These are important skills for personal and professional growth. I think that by being creative, self-motivated, self-aware and reflective, I have been able to achieve positive outcomes in various aspects of my life.

It has not been easy to improve my reflections. I have been asking my colleagues students to look at my work. The feedback I received was helpful. Thanks to them, I realized that I should fix spelling mistakes. I use a tool for that called Grammarly. Another hint was to write clear and understandable sentences. Reviewers told me that a paragraph was clear and obvious for me but not for anyone else. To fix sentences and make sure everything is clear and understandable, I use chat GPT. [LO2.4.2.3]
After achieving some decent level of reflection I started giving my work to Tom McCallum. His reviews were rough but he had got the point. He gave me advice to not fix my old reflection but to create another one better. By constant improving and developing cycle I was learning how to write good reflection because I understood my strengths and weaknesses.

I experimented with different reflection formats and found the one that works best for me. At first, I tried using Gibbs’ reflective cycle, which consists of six stages: description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, and action plan. However, I found this format too rigid and confusing for my learning process. I often mixed up the stages or skipped some of them. I learned the meaning and purpose of each stage, but I did not feel comfortable applying them to my experiences. Then, I found an original set of questions from older students that suited me better. These questions helped me focus on the topic that I was working on and ask myself critical questions such as “So what?”, “What did I learn from that?” and “How does it teach me what to do now?”. These questions helped me extract value from my reflections and make a plan for my development. Therefore, I realized that the most important part of reflection is not following a fixed format, but finding the questions that stimulate my thinking and learning.

In conclusion, I have learned a lot from this exploration of my skills and attributes related to creativity, self-motivation and self-awareness. I have realized that these qualities are essential for my personal and professional development.
