Software security and resilience are essential aspects of software development. In this reflection, I will share some insights that I gained from attending an industry session at Adobe where they discussed different types of testing. I will also relate these insights to my current project and previous notes about automatic checks.
(Adobe Industry session, 2022)[LO2.5.1.4]
I'm reading my notes from an industry session at Adobe where they discussed various types of testing.(What is end-to-end testing?, 2022) One of the types they mentioned was End-to-End (E2E) testing, which simulates real-life scenarios to ensure that the application is ready for such situations. E2E testing checks application performance and helps predictably detect bugs, which can cause exploits and be used by hackers to extract data.[LO2.5.1.4]
(What is system integration testing (SIT),  2023)
During the session, System Integration Testing (SIT) was also discussed. SIT makes the software more resilient to threats by detecting defects early and providing feedback to ensure correct data flow, timing, memory usage, and software requirements. Overall, SIT helps ensure the quality and functionality of the software system as a whole.
[LO2.5.1.4]
Gary Anderson from Adobe also mentioned Unit tests, Load tests, Soak tests, Penetration testing, and Logging tests. At the end of the day, it's up to the user to ensure software resilience. This can be achieved by conducting periodic security scans and audits, reporting any suspicious or anomalous activity, and using reliable and trustworthy sources while following the best practices and guidelines for security and risk management.
(Ongoing threats, 2023)[LO2.5.1.4]
In my previous notes about automatic checks, I mentioned Francesco's suggestions. In our latest meeting, he introduced an online tool called CVE Mitre, which I can use to scan all the libraries in the current project. It indicates whether a library has vulnerabilities and how to fix them. So, I'll discuss this tool with my colleagues from COORD.

I learned about various types of testing that can help me improve the security and resilience of my software applications. Testing is a valuable method to ensure software quality and functionality. I understand that I should keep learning and applying new techniques and tools to enhance the security and resilience of my applications.
