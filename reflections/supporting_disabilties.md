Recently, I have had the opportunity to participate in a couple of interesting projects that have taught me a lot about the importance of data-driven applications and accessibility considerations. The first project, COORD, was an app designed to help drivers and users find specific places or addresses on a map. [LO2.6.2.5]It was a team effort, and we relied heavily on existing data stored in our database to provide users with accurate information.(Bogdan, T., 2023)[LO2.6.2.5] Another project, Shop in List, was an app I designed and created to help people struggling with weekly shopping by combining products into dinner and generating a full list of products for the week while summarizing the price.
(Renaud, K. and Coles-Kemp, L., 2022)
During the COORD project, we made an effort to consider the needs of disabled users.[LO2.4.1.5] We implemented various design elements such as dark mode, big buttons mode, and larger fonts that can be easily accessed through user browser settings. It was a learning experience for me to realize that people with motor disabilities may struggle to interact with keyboards and mice, highlighting the importance of making our applications more user-friendly for all.
(Renaud, K. and Coles-Kemp, L., 2022)
"Cyber security is a relatively new field, and efforts to improve its usability are barely two decades old."
Cybersecurity was also a significant concern we addressed, especially since disabled individuals may be at higher risk for scams, and hackers may see their disabilities as valuable information. One way to improve cybersecurity is through an informational campaign. (Ford, A. et al., 2022)
"In almost all cases, this negative economic impact on market value far outweighed the monetary value of the fine itself, and relatively minor fines could result in major market valuation losses for companies, even those having large market capitalisations."
& "legislation in this area to encourage firms to invest in cyber security and protect the privacy of data subjects"
(Todorow, B., 2023)[LO2.6.2.2]
I also learned that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to invest in security and rethink how to process data.(ncsc.gov.uk, 2021)
[LO2.6.1.4] GDPR encourages companies to invest in cybersecurity, and it is essential to prioritize it in any data-driven application development process.
However, there is still a need for information campaigns and additional measures to ensure that disabled users are not excluded from accessing services due to security features. Potential solutions include voice messages or image recognition as part of security validation. (Rui & Yan, 2018) [LO2.4.2.2]It is also essential to protect biometric authentication data from being faked or stolen, as this information could be especially valuable to hackers. Overall, my experiences working on data-driven projects have highlighted the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in technology design, as well as the need for continued efforts to improve cybersecurity for all users.
[LO2.6.1.4]
During one of the ITDI sessions, I discussed saving email addresses on a new channel with Alistair. He explained that because of GDPR, individuals can request that all their data related to them be deleted when they leave a job in the future. Searching for data spread across multiple channels could be challenging and underscores the importance of adhering to GDPR regulations.
