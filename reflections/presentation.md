Recently, I have been attending the job center as a student looking for a job. I have been receiving support from my work coach, who asked me to provide a presentation that I could show to potential employers. I am grateful to have another person helping me improve my skills and explain my abilities.

During the sprint review on February 03, 2023, I was the only person in my team who knew what was happening, and I knew that the project would not be ready in time. Instead of chasing the deadline, I taught my team members about professional work on branches and pull requests, hoping to salvage some value from the project. For the sprint review, I prepared a presentation about how our team had improved our skills and what we had learned.

However, during the meeting, nobody seemed to appreciate my effort, and my joy was systematically extinguished. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about not taking things personally and being proud of my work, regardless of others' opinions. I also realized that I should be more consistent with my vocabulary and build phrases more smoothly.

The sprint review on March 17, 2023, did not go well either. I struggled to find the right words, stopping for too long and searching for words to finish my sentences. Although English is not my native language, I learned that I should always be prepared for questions and be ready to defend my part of the presentation.

Since January 2023, I have been trying to apply for a job, attending multiple job interviews and gaining confidence along the way. However, I still felt that I was missing something. So, I asked a senior developer friend and my mentor to help me test my self-presentation skills. They gave me some insightful hints, teaching me to be more confident about my strengths and show my interest in the company.

Overall, my experiences with job interviews and sprint reviews have taught me valuable lessons about presenting myself professionally, working with a team, and not taking things personally. These lessons will help me in my future endeavors, both personally and professionally.
