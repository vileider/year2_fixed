Through my exploration of data mining, I have gained a deeper understanding of how valuable information can be extracted from large and complex data sets. In this reflection, I will summarize what I learned about data mining and relate it to a real problem.[LO2.6.1.5]
(ibm.com, 2023)
From the information based on the IBM website, there are generally four steps: setting goals, data preparation, applying mining algorithms, and finally evaluating the results.

I discovered that there are two main types of data mining: descriptive to summarize of data set and predictive to create a forecast based on patterns found in data.
(Team, D.F., 2021)[LO2.6.1.5]
I learned there are several mining algorithms, each one is designed for a specific purpose. For example, some algorithms are more suitable for classification other can handle large data. Therefore, I learned that choosing the right algorithm for a data mining task depends on a desired outcome.
I think that combining the right data mining and algorithm can result in perfect data analysis, insights and solutions.

One example of a real problem that can benefit from data mining described on IBM website
"As Facebook alone crunches 600 terabytes of new data every single day. Also, the primary challenge of big data is how to make sense of it."
I think data mining can help Facebook to discover useful patterns and trends by analyzing bought products, used services, and other user experiences. Data mining can also help Facebook to predict user behavior, preferences, and needs, and provide personalized and relevant content, recommendations, and advertisements.

I think I am a witness of data mining every day as a user of Facebook, YouTube, and Google. I see personalized commercials and content that are based on my online activity and preferences. This shows me how data mining can influence our daily lives and choices

Overall, learned that data mining is an essential and evolving process that analyzes data as it is collected over time. Data mining can help us to discover useful information from large and complex data sets, such as patterns, trends, anomalies, and predictions.
