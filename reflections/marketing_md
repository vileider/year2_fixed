In this outcome, I learned about the difference between features and benefits of a product. Features are describing specifications or characteristics of a product, such as batteries for a toy or an app that is translated to 20 most popular languages. Benefits are what convinces customers to buy a product at first place, such as tasty food and short waiting time for a restaurant or good sleep quality for a bed. I understood that features show that a product has high value, but they are not the reason why customers buy it.

To apply this knowledge, I chose an example of antivirus software and identified its main benefits and features. The main benefits are real-time protection and system scanning, which are essential for keeping the computer safe from viruses and malware. The features are hiding IP address, ad block, speeding up desktops, removing temporary internet files, and updating existing operating system software and drivers. These features enhance the performance and security of the computer, but they are not the primary motivation for buying the antivirus software.

In conclusion, I have learned that features are what a product does, while benefits are what it does for the customer. I have also learned how to use them effectively in a marketing campaign by focusing on the benefits that appeal to the customerâ€™s  needs and by supporting them with relevant features. This skill will help me to create more persuasive and engaging marketing messages for my future projects.

One thing I was not sure if it was relevant or important for the customer. For example, I wondered if translating an app to 20 languages mattered for the customer who only spoke one language. I think I could improve my understanding of this topic by doing more research on customer needs and preferences.
