LO2.4.2.1
Software services
Explain agile project delivery and show how it applies to the roll out of a software project, ensuring an accurate and timely deployment in a customer friendly way, consistent with the customer needs.
You should have some notes already on agile project delivery from first year. Build on those to answer the first part. Then relate those notes to your projects. You should be looking to do some sort of continuous deployment which meets the needs of an audience. If its a fictional audience you have to justify your deployment strategy - easily done by comparing how you are doing it to other companies with real products. Ensure you reference your sources.

LO2.5.1.3
Software architecture
Apply analytical and critical thinking skills to Technology Solutions development and to systematically analyse and apply structured problem-solving techniques to them.
So this is basically your Design Thinking - not the Hopes and Fears but those tools that help you break down the problem into steps and priorities. This can also cover breaking a problem into classes/functions. You want to tag evidence of code or pdfs and reflect on the techniques you used by researching various problem solving techniques and processes for systematically breaking down problems.

LO2.5.2.1
Software Quality Assurance
Analyse the importance for the need to identify and manage project deliverables, identifying benefits for development and customer.
You need to analyse, not just say its important! Why is it important, cite some case studies, cite some projects where it has gone wrong and why. Are there common reasons for projects to fail? If so what are they?

LO2.6.2.1
Data as a service
Evaluate the quality assurance processes that can be automated during software development to achieve and maintain project requirements.
What are QA processes? Where do you find them? How are they automated? In order to evaluate them you need to be able to set them up - you can do this in Bitbucket or IBM Cloud. You need to use them to maintain your software quality. We would expect to see some evidence of research, evidence of linkedin learning courses taken and attempts at implementations - even if they don't work - say so and say what might be going wrong! Failure is always on the path to success so its important we see that so we can credit you for trying!

If any, what do I want to start doing or continue?

If any, what do I want to stop doing?

plan for reflection:
(I will explain how our team was delivering project on time. how agile helped delivering software.)
(How did we managed satisfy customer and make it user-friendly.) (How important is to identify results from development and client point of view.)
(how did our team have been critic on the project.)
(examples:
-design thinking
-retrospective
-inviting Karen to solve problems)
(How can add tests and automate them. How that would help to achieve project requirements. )
(Any failures while trying to achieve above.)
