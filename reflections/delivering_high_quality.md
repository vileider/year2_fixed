Every new team project shows me a new point of view. Every iteration of the team working exercise let me approach tasks in a better way. This is how I managed to do it this time

[LO2.5.2.1]The last team project did not go well from the client's perspective. I think that was because we did not present a project at all. (Todorow, Notes from industry session 2023) At the "Developer round table" Barnaby said it is necessary to deliver a product even if it has bad quality. The good side is that we improve the code quality by sending pull requests. I learned how to review others' code. (Todorow, PR review 2023) I had more opportunities to see how others review my code.[LO2.4.2.1] [LO2.5.1.3] At the end of the sprint, we did a retrospective and we pointed out things that were blocking us or the project.[LO2.5.2.1] I think that helped our team to identify our weak points and Issues that we should take care of in the first place. [LO2.5.1.3](Todorow, Team Spock retrospective part 1 & part 2 2023) I learned what other team members might think. I knew that they might be confused sometimes. Although I did not know that each member of our team have a different vision for our project. I think that in the future new functionality in games or on the active interface should be drawn and presented in some ordered diagram for clarity. Maybe there is a tool for that. I will do some research.

[LO2.5.2.1]Unfortunately, team Spock did not satisfy customer needs. We worked hard to keep the quality of code, however, if a product is not delivered, I do not think someone will be diving into code to, for example, admire the beauty of professionally formatted lines.

[LO2.4.2.1] [LO2.5.1.3] It is essential to finish the project with a retrospective. In that way, we would be able to identify the pros and cons of the taken solutions. [LO2.5.2.1]We identified it from the client's perspective. (Todorow, Notes from industry session 2023) At the Industry session, James said it is beneficial to speak to a customer after delivering a product. It improves relations and might give a piece of extra advice to the product owner and the development team. James also advised running an analytics tool to see if completed products are giving a profit.

In Team Spock team I did not find an opportunity to create any test or automation.[LO2.6.2.1] (Todorow, IBM pipeline stages 2023)Regardless I have Continuus integration on IBM. It is created for my private project co-created with students and friends. This pipeline deploys a freshly committed react app from my git repository. In the last week, I managed to add a test stage to my project. My project is not test-driven however I would like to create future sub-projects in that way. Automation helps focus on the project instead of manually pushing new app versions to the host.[LO2.5.2.1] (Todorow, Automated test failed on IBM 2023)The test stage prevents deploying bugged or broken code and what is important I do not have to test every time manually. I still have to learn more advanced tools like Jenkins or mentioned by Simone Jidoka

[LO2.5.2.1]I think our team should be contacting customers more often. That kind of meeting would keep our team on track and remind the importance of delivering products on time. Because we did not contact the customer too often we did not discuss delays.[LO2.4.2.1] I think it was partially caused by not choosing the scrum master and product owner until the last sprint. I understand now the importance of the scrum master and product owner in the project.  

(Todorow, Agile@REST 2021) Honest and open discussion helps to improve project workflow. Sometimes team members do not participate actively during stand-up discussions. Even if I will encourage them to be more open they still stay close to their shell. Maybe they need more time, however, I will not focus on that because that can lead to a distraction. Retrospective in the environment when part of the group is involved in a project can be accomplished only partially. I think that I gained priceless experience this way.[LO2.4.2.1] A self-organized Agile team should be open to changes. Perhaps mental flexibility will be useful in real work in the industry. 

In the middle of the project, I noticed that our team is drifting in the wrong direction. I decide to invite Karen to our daily meeting. She explained how we should solve minor problems and that we should not be distracted by small ones and just rise issues during a retrospective at the end of the sprint.

(Todorow, Agile notes 2022) According to my notes and reflection, the best way to solve a problem is through open discussion. The agile manifesto says that integration with the customer/client is essential. I think I forgot about that point. For my next project, I will try to be in better contact with a client unless someone will take the product owner role. (Todorow, Notes from industry session 2023) [LO2.6.2.1]Relating to CI/cd pipeline Simone said Jidoka is a helpful tool. After a small research, I learned that it is a tool that automatically fixes issues. I will need to dive into it and test it.
