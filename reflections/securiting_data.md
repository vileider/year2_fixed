(Todorow, B., 2023)
Referring to my recent reflection about information security(InfoSec) and GDPR.(collinsdictionary, 2023) I realize that the technical aspect contains various elements such as knowledge, skills, methods, machines, or systems that are used (Imperva, 2023). I also learned that InfoSec involves tools and processes that are designed to protect information from unauthorized activities, with three key principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. I understood that cybersecurity is a part of InfoSec(Imperva, 2023).
[LO2.6.1.4]
I realised that to implement information security into an organization, a first step is to start risk management process that identifies potential threats. It applies to appropriate control measures, such as encryption, authentication, firewall backups, and more (Data Protection, 2015). I also discovered that the Technical Aspect of the Data Protection Act in the UK follows the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Information Commissioner's Office, which is the UK authority, regulates and enforces data protection laws and rights (legislation.gov.uk, 2018). Another important rule I found is that personal data must be treated with strict data protection standards, including honest, lawful, open, accurate, and secure usage by anyone who handles it.
[LO2.6.1.4]
I believe that holding to the principles of information security, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability, is crucial for the success of any project I participate in, both currently and in the future. I understand that protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or modification and ensuring data availability when needed are essential aspects of information security. By following these principles, I can contribute to safeguarding the project's information and maintaining the trust of stakeholders. I also recognize the importance of conducting risk assessments for every project I participate in to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats.

Recently, during a job interview with a client, I took the opportunity to educate her respectfully on the significance of information security and the individual responsibilities we all have in protecting sensitive data. 

In conclusion, I am committed to continuously improving my knowledge and skills in information security, and integrating its principles into my work to protect sensitive data and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. By following best practices, conducting risk assessments, and promoting awareness, I aim to contribute to the success of projects I participate in and uphold the highest standards of information security.
