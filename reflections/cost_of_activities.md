(Todorow, digital development principles)
During my "adventure" at ASD course in various projects with different team members, I realized that we never utilized phased contingency. Instead, we focused on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) sprint by sprint. Due to my lack of experience, I never predicted project failure. However, looking back at my past projects, I believe I can estimate and predict appropriate phased contingency now.

In my current project, COORD, we are using burn-down charts to estimate how many tasks we can add to the board. This has been a helpful tool in evaluating team velocity and making sure we are on track to meet project deadlines.
[LO2.5.2.3](Todorow, burdownchart)
While discussing evaluation tools with my mentor Francesco, he suggested using the burn-down chart in Jira to estimate team velocity.[LO2.5.1.1] By analyzing different charts on the Jira board, I am able to evaluate project progress from different perspectives. Combining my experience with data, I can estimate where to allocate resources and where crisis situations may arise. For example, in a one of a project from the past, I anticipated losing team members or team members not putting in enough effort. Therefore, I focused on my own development and teaching other team members how to use source control, which would be beneficial in the long term and for future projects.
Right now I know it was not the right approach.

Relating to an other successful project - the goal was to create a simple chat on one framework. However, after two weeks, we made so much progress that we decided to use three more frameworks and create a mobile version. We achieved it but last piece of code was written 5 min before presenting to the client. It is difficult to estimate project phased contingency without basic data. While I can rely on my experience, when working with a new team, I think I should be realistic and set small goals. Furthermore I should use designated evaluation tool.

Through my experiences and by constant using of tools such as burn-down charts, I have learned the importance of estimating phased contingency and allocating and managing resources appropriately. Once I will get familiar with existing tools on Jira I will discuss further improvement with my mentor, team and teachers.
