Throughout this academic year, I have been using various project management techniques such as Scrum and Kanban. I reflected on it(environmental Impact, 2023) and I realized that these techniques have helped me become more efficient in managing my projects. (My Tools 1 - 3, 2023) Additionally, I have been using several tools that I used last year, and I found even more like the Postman. It is an excellent HTTP request tool that has helped me with testing and debugging.[LO2.6.1.1]

In terms of cloud services, I have had 12 months of experience with both AWS and IBM. While AWS can be expensive, I have learned to use its services carefully. IBM, on the other hand, is more complicated, but it is worth using, and since I am a student, I can explore its services for free. However, I have found that I prefer Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) on Linux over big commercial hosting services. Although it requires knowledge of Linux commands, it compensates for costs and ease of maintenance. On a VPS, I can install any database, development board, or even the entire GitLab ecosystem, just like the COORD team does.

After starting several new projects, I have polished my skills to a decent level. Before starting a new project, I make sure to clearly define the goals and objectives, as well as the scope of work t. I put the most significant pressure on planning, as I have noticed that if the first two or three sprints are well planned, everyone is more enthusiastic about the project, and their productivity improves. To monitor project progress and team efficiency, I use a burndown chart, which has helped keep track of tasks and milestones. Overall, I have found that following industry-standard processes, methods, techniques, and tools has helped me execute my projects more efficiently and effectively.

I plan to continue using agile methodologies such as scrum and kanban in my future projects, as they have been effective in improving productivity and collaboration among team members. I will continue to monitor project progress and team efficiency using burndown charts to ensure that the project stays on track and meets its goals. To improve my skills, I plan to use LinkedIn Learning and YouTube video tutorials, as well as the resources available on FreeCodeCamp. Overall, I aim to continually improve my project execution skills and stay up-to-date with industry-standard processes, methods, techniques, and tools.
