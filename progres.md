### 05.10.2022

I was learning c++
attended to Douglas Bar session

### 07.10.2022

retrospective
I will focus on positive aspects and I want tell everyone What went well.

team member might be finding task very overwhelming. But we did all we could to participate in the project. We were worrying about what we needed to know and where to start. WE were having stand-ups, trying to learn how to organise a sprint planning meeting, keeping Jira up to date and writing reflections. I'm sure all of us have been asking and digging into similar topic and I guess there is no singular solution to encapsulate them all, this couple sprints was not all about learning how to create framework or creating big successful 100% fully finished projects, most real projects never get finished and for this might it will be the same, sure we wanted to dedicate the time to completing a project. I think it is more about the learning aspect of it. Some of us might do some front end, html and CSS, the next some back end and then maybe some CI/CD pipelines, as long as you are learning something and can evidence our learning in your reflective work, add notes and PDP you will pass without issue.
Our biggest achievement is manage to keep all team up to date with the progress.

JS better function usage.

### 3.2.2023

presentation speech:
"In this week I focused on adding a code formatter to a project.
It can greatly improve the readability and organize the code. code formatter is important if we want to make code easier to maintain and understand.
I also added simple script to unify the way how prettier is organizing spaces. thanks to that our team can save time and eliminate the potential for human error,
Well-formatted code can demonstrate a higher level of professionalism and attention to detail which as I am concern is a standard in industry. Code formatting make it easier for students and teachers to review and understand the project, it leads to more constructive feedback and a better final product.
It is important to choose a code formatter that is widely used and well-supported in the programming community to ensure compatibility with other tools and projects.

Code formatter and a script to automate the formatting process is enhancing the quality and maintainability of a college project.
It is a valuable investment of time and effort that can pay off in the long run."

thoughts about daily meetings. From my perspective these developers forgot the difference between kaban and scrum.
I said that there is a difference between kaban and scrum of stand-ups. I explained that we are working in agile with
scrum and week short sprints.
source on which I based my reserach:
https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/daily-stand-up#:~:text=Frequently%20asked%20questions.-,What%20is%20a%20stand-up%20meeting%20in%20Agile%3F,the%20last%20stand-up%20meeting.

I was working hard helping team member during pull requests. I send my task
### 17 - 23.2.2023
I sent Learning outcomes reflection
I was learning Jira board
I created and attached Jira to my private repo on git hub
I was learning react:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_Wqx3RnHk&t=813s
I attend to Database session and mad some notes
### 24.2.2023 - 2.3.2023
I have been attending to guest lectures 
Worked under outcome evidences
communicating over email with my mentor
started 2 new project with 2 different teams
One project is about placement at uhi and IT support as a devOps
Other is abitious student project 
### 4.3.2023 - 13.3.2023
It is very busy at both projects.
At the UHI one I was trying to understand whole architecture.
Loose coupled structure shows me an example of well designed and secured system
At students project well documented app description let the whole team to 
self organized and keep team progress going.

I had a session with mentor
at the meeting I asked Francesco if he has any experience working offshore or inshore
He said that Adobe creates a company in a country and hires people that way.
I asked about learning outcome and one was about waterfall method
My mentor replied that it is still useful in space industry.
I also asked him about evaluation methods in practice
scrum: at the beginning of the scrum I establish what is my current goal
at sprint planning I should do estimation cost and populate board with tickets.
After every sprint team should evaluate what can we achieve
after 1 sprint I will be able to estimate realistic time of project end
it would take 6 months of data to estimate velocity of the team
About tests:
test should be done particularly for UI
TDD should be for everything unless it is impossible
coding without tests - extreme programming require pair programming

While reviewing code should have ci/cd pipeline

evaluation tools for developers: 
* estimation from JIRA,
* GitHub: activity, line of code committed

different point of evaluation gives more data so it will let me evaluate it better.
Time spent and time base can estimate the story point in the future.

quarterly review is better that year review because more often reviews put you on track
If reviews are to often they become too burden
If there is too much objections review does not help because I would have to change to much
Every evaluation should be specially prepared for a chosen person
On every step of carrier ladder it should be written what is expected from a person.

### 14.3.2023
I had 2 meetings with college team and placement 
Allister said AdConnect changes group names at AD on premises
I meet with Gary Ryan

I expanded reflection in progress
###
As a part of  ITDI placement I was taking a part in UHI developer team meeting.
Session with mentor:
working with for example git kraken could be useful to understand source control
source tree program
testing are about black box testing i do not rely on implementation but on what I expect
jest would allow me nesting

### 
# ITDI session
we need to check student environment status
In AD their are several groups and Jem is not clear which groups can be turned into another
It is easy to convert it by changing email address

At sits we need to check what connect student with sits
where enrolment is are connected to?
Is there a status on "ScJ"?
We need to check student AD location and
staff and location
software licencing is build on being 
in a group--sci student column and the course group
Can I find an enrolment instead of checking if it is in the course group?
Is "students" on the course or "SCJ" or "sPR"

A:It is relate with the founding, SQ

What make students part of the AD group?
what is a difference between the groups?
what attributes can be added to group any limitation - in active directory
while getting into another group does my account duplicates or do I get 
registered at AD?
Azure doesn't have option to filter account that is why I see all accounts.
I can still exist on a SITS view and because a filter at MIM might not know about me.
Can I be part of two groups with 1 attribute that are collided with each other how is it solved
Is it solved that on one group attribute does not even appear?
there is automatic licencing students
we need to tell MIM to not drop the group when they see the students
we can find an atribute that sais do not take studenst from group

If i vamn find an atribute in sits
if att says it is acitve
the code intaht linke can sqy it is true 
it would solve the problem
### 23.3.2023 
# ITDI
from sits manula we should look for PRS (record locations)
we should look for sutable atribute for it
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/active-directory-schema

in that list and relevant data

AMISH is on SITS

Whe have to find a sits
# Coord
after stand up we have been setting up server for Gitlab.
free trial expires soon so we decided to move it to 

###  24.3.2023
# ITDI 
I asked why people on uhi do not use something like slack and communicate to each other
And allistar said that it is to protect the developers. Otherway if the person who shout the most would be hear only.

Alexander mentioned a phrase "bus factor", which means it iss and Alistar said that in UHI it is called "single point of exelence"



### I id some so
