First thing in the morning was helpful as it gave a good start

Task ownership & responsibility
_ To track tasks, use assignee
_ Checklists seem like a good idea for keeping track of individual completion but do not work.
_ Virtuous circle of thinking about how quickly tasks move from Backlog to Done and not getting stuck in a particular column.
_ Comments are key to be transparent with team on progress.
_ If task does not move quickly, split it up and remove the larger one.
_ (To try) Limit number of tasks of a particular type to increase variation amongst team members

- Breaking down the problem

  - Hard to do initially when knowledge is sparse.
  - Breaking down learning
  - Adding learning to Jira
  - Recording short videos of what you have learned for the others
  - Divide learning up - not everyone needs to learn everything
  - Checklists did not work for tracking learning.

- Jira Setup
  - Use of epics, maybe epic per person and a backlog epic to keep all tasks.
  - Use of the filters to see what an individual is doing.
  - Think about the level of detail on Epics, User stories and how it impacts discussion and creativity.
- Tracking commits
  - Use the reports in Jira to track progress, may be add them to daily stand-up.
- Getting help from team and escalating to delivery team
  - Finding resources that are at the wrong level,
  - Single file format and how that plays into a larger piece of work
  - Escalate challenges in understanding to team
